Pashua Runner
=============

Open a [Pashua][] form file (with `.pashua` extension) by double clicking (or pressing `âŒ˜O`) on the file in Finder.

Ideal, Pashua would do this itself. This project acts as a proof of concept and a temporary work-around.

Usage
-----

You can download [Pashua-Runner.app.zip][release] from the _Assets_ of the latest release, uncompress it and move it to the `Applications` or `Apps` folder.

Now you can double click the `example.pashua` file in this repository, and the form will be opened.
